# ANN-final-project
final project of the lecture on ANN<br>
project description:<br>
In this project, you need to develop a novel model or method to solve the 40-class skin disease classification task. The challenge is that only 60 images are available for each skin disease class. So this is a small-sample recognition problem. To solve this problem, you may try to explore various advanced techniques like transfer learning, domain adaptation, relation between images and between classes, attention to lesion regions for classification, etc. Using your novel model or method, I expect you can achieve the performance at least with overall accuracy 80% and mean class recall 80%. Due to the limited data, 5-fold cross-validation may be used to evaluate your model or method.
